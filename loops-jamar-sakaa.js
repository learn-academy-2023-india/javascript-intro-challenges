// Create a for loop that logs each number from 1 - 20.

// Create a for loop that logs every other number from 1 - 20.
// Create a for loop that logs the result of each number from 1 - 20 tripled.
// Create a for loop that logs each even number from 1-20, and in the place of every odd number, returns the word "ODD".
// Expected output: ODD, 2, ODD, 4, ODD, 6 ...etc
// Consider this variable:

// const nums = [3, 57, -9, 20, 67]
// Create the code that will log the largest number from the array.
// Create the code that will log the smallest number from the array.
// Create the code that will log the remainder of each number when divided by 2.
// Expected output: 1, 1, -1, 0, 1
// Consider this variable:

// const myString = "learn student"
// Create the code that will log the number of times the letter "e" occurs in the string.
// Create the code that will log every other character in the string.
